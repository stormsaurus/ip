# ip
Image and signal processor including a specialized implementation of the Legendre-Fenchel transform.

## description

This is one of my first useful but quite dated Java programs prior to professionally coding. It was developed to support research into two dimensional monolayer domain growth. It's a port of several routines previously written by a collaborator in Fortran with some new functions and a UI put on top and batch processing added.

It is defintely not best practice code and predated much of what Java eventually became.

## usage

Sinful binary included in dist directory.

```java -jar IP_3_0_2a.jar```
